Feature: recommend new friends to a person on Facebook

    In order to recommend new friends to a person on Facebook
    As an programmer of 'Facebook'
    I want to have an algorithm to do this for me

    Scenario: with more friendships than people #friendship is wederzijds
      Given a social media network
      And a friendships is a two-way connection
      And 5 people  #with 5 people, the total amount of connections between the nodes is 10. First person, node, can connect with 4 people, than the next 3, the other 2, the last with one other person. Because friendships are a two-way connection.
      And 8 friendships
      When I recommend new friendships
      Then at most 2 new friendships can be recommended

    Scenario: with less friendships than people
      Given a social media network
      And a frienship is a two-way connection
      And 5 people
      And 4 friendships
      When I recommend new friendships
      Then at most 6 new friendships can be recommended
      And at least 2 people do not have a friendship


    Scenario: with more friendships than people
      Given a social media network
      And a friendship is a one-way connection
      And 5 people #within 5 people, the total amount of connection between the nodes is 20. It's the same as in the first scenario but multiplied by 2 since a friendship now consists out of a one-way connection.
      And 15 friendships
      When I recommend new friendships
      Then at most 5 new friendships can be recommended
